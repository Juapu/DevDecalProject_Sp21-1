1. Web3 by itself isn't able to communicate with the blockchain so we give it a
provider object. We then call web3 functions to interact with the etherium network
like getting an account and contract instance which deals with the provider under
the hood. Because a contract instance is created, any call the user makes will be
converted to an ABI call.
2. I will attempt to explain the buyloot function. The function listens to an event.
contracts and accounts are set to their respective constant values. The event is
canceled if it is cancelable. Otherwise the state is set to loading. The contracts
buyToken method is called, loot is transferred, and buying is set to null as
there is no more buying going on. Errors will be caught and an alert will be thrown.
